- New camera stuck in the ground after battle (difficult to fix)
Low priority:
- The zap movies sometimes prematurely jump to the death animation (just a visual bug)
- Tutorial with new camera is broken (skipped for now, develop new tutorial later)
- With 2 instakill sounds, only the first goes off (very minor bug)
